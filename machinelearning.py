âœ… What is Machine Learning?

You use the training set to teach the model how to make predictions.

Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) where computers learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed for every case.

ðŸ“Œ Types of Machine Learning

Supervised Learning

Model learns from labeled data (input â†’ correct output).

Example: Predicting house prices based on features like area, location.

Unsupervised Learning

Model finds patterns without labels.

Example: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.

Reinforcement Learning

Model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

Example: Self-learning robots, game-playing AI.



ðŸ“Œ Basic Steps in Machine Learning

Data Collection â†’ Data Cleaning â†’ Feature Selection â†’ Encoding â†’ Scaling â†’ Splitting
       â†“
 Model Selection â†’ Training â†’ Validation â†’ Testing â†’ Performance Analysis â†’ Improvement
       â†“
 Final Training â†’ Saving â†’ Deployment â†’ Monitoring

 

ðŸ“Œ Where Exactly Does Preprocessing Happen?

Data Collection â†’ **Preprocessing** â†’ Splitting â†’ Model Training â†’ Validation â†’ Testing â†’ Deployment

Preprocessing happens:
âœ” Immediately after collecting the raw data
âœ” Before splitting it into train/test sets
âœ” Sometimes also applied after splitting (e.g., scaling fitted only on training data and applied to test data)



âœ… Why pandas is Imported
ðŸ“¦ Pandas is for Data Handling

It helps in organizing, manipulating, and analyzing structured data (like tables, spreadsheets, CSV files).

It makes it easy to:

Load datasets.

Select columns and rows.

Filter, aggregate, and transform data.

Handle missing values and work with time series.


âœ… Why numpy is Imported
ðŸ“¦ NumPy is for Numerical Operations

It provides support for efficient array operations and mathematical computations.

Used for linear algebra, random number generation, and scientific computing.

ðŸ“Š Where Itâ€™s Used

Even if it's not explicitly used in your house price code, libraries like scikit-learn internally rely on numpy arrays for computations. For example:

The feature matrix X and target vector y are automatically converted to numpy arrays.

Operations like fitting the model and calculating errors use efficient matrix math handled by numpy.

âœ… Why matplotlib is Imported
ðŸ“¦ Matplotlib is for Visualization

It helps you create graphs, charts, and plots to understand the data, inspect model performance, and communicate results.

Visualizing data gives you insights like:

How data is distributed

Whether thereâ€™s a relationship between variables

How well your model fits the data


âœ… Why sklearn is Imported
ðŸ“¦ scikit-learn (sklearn) is for Machine Learning

Itâ€™s a powerful library that provides tools for:

Splitting datasets

Applying machine learning algorithms

Preprocessing data

Evaluating models using metrics

Tuning parameters, cross-validation, etc.
